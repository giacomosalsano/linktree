## General Information

This project was developed with the following tools:

- Project Name: **Link Tree for Social Media**;
- Version: 1.0;
- Technologies Used: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Figma, GitHub;
- Run the Project: Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.


## General Description
The **Link Tree for Social Media** is a simple personal webpage that aggregates various social media and portfolio links. The webpage features a profile picture, interactive social media icons, a visit counter, and a light/dark mode toggle to improve the user experience.

### 2.1 Purpose
- This project was designed to provide a central location for users to access all of my personal accounts: social media, music, modeling, and design portfolios through a clean and minimalistic interface.
- The project also serves to demonstrate web development skills such as styling with `CSS`, using `JavaScript` for interactivity, and applying responsive design principles.

### 2.2 Scope
The system includes the following functionalities:

- Display of a personal profile picture and username;
- Light and dark mode toggle for a customizable viewing experience;
- A list of links to various social media platforms and portfolio websites;
- A visit counter to track how many times the page has been accessed;
- Social media icons that link to external platforms like Instagram, LinkedIn, SoundCloud, GitHub, etc.;
- An inspiring quote displayed at the bottom of the page.

## 3. Design Overview
- The design of the webpage is minimalist with a strong focus on user experience;
- The layout is centered, with a profile image, username, and various links arranged vertically;
- The light/dark mode toggle is positioned above the links, providing easy access to change the appearance;
- Social media icons are presented as a grid at the bottom, giving users quick access to external profiles.

## 4. Use Case View
### Use Cases:
1. Toggle Light/Dark Mode:
    - Input: User clicks on the light/dark mode switch;
    - Output: The page's background and text color change, toggling between a light theme and a dark theme.

2. Visit Links:
    - Input: User clicks on any link in the list (e.g., Instagram, Behance);
    - Output: The corresponding external website opens in a new tab.


## 5. Technical Implementation
The **Link Tree for Social Media** consists of three main files:

- `index.html`: The main HTML structure, which defines the layout, content, and structure of the webpage. It also includes links to external stylesheets and scripts.
- `style.css`: The CSS file that contains all the styles for the page, including layouts, colors, hover effects, and media queries for responsiveness.
- `script.js`: A JavaScript file that handles the light/dark mode toggle functionality, providing interactivity to the page.

### 5.1 HTML Structure
- The HTML defines the structure of the page with a container that holds the profile, links, social media icons, and footer;
- The `profile` section displays an image and the username;
- The `ul_links` list contains the main links to external sites;
- The `social_links` section holds icons for additional social media platforms;
- The `quote` section displays an inspirational quote;
- The `footer` provides attribution for the website creator.

### 5.2 CSS Styling
- The page is designed to be responsive, with media queries to adjust the background images for different screen sizes;
- Colors, fonts, and layouts are controlled using CSS variables to facilitate easy theme switching (light/dark mode);
- The design includes hover effects and transitions to improve the interactivity of the links and buttons.

### 5.3 JavaScript Interactivity
- The `script.js` file defines the `toggleMode` function, which switches the page between light and dark modes by toggling the `light_mode` class on the HTML element.

## 6. Features and Functionalities
- Light/Dark Mode: Toggle between light and dark themes by clicking the button on the page;
- Visit Links: Direct users to the respective social media or portfolio websites;
- Social Media Icons: Provide quick access to all my social media platforms like Instagram, LinkedIn, GitHub, etc;
- Visit Counter: Displays the number of times the page has been visited, using [StarHits](https://hits.seeyoufarm.com/) to track the visit count;
- Quote: “**_Ad meliora et ad maiora semper_**” is a Latin phrase that translates to "_always towards better and greater things_". It is a reminder to keep moving forward and strive for greater dreams.

## 7. User Interaction
- Users can toggle between light and dark mode using the button located at the top of the page;
- Clicking on any of the links will open the respective external website in a new browser tab;
- Social media icons are interactive and will open in a new tab when clicked;
- The visit counter dynamically updates the number of visits.
